# ðŸš€ My First Rust Project

Welcome to my very first project using the **Rust programming language** â€” a powerful, modern systems language focused on performance, safety, and concurrency.

This project marks the beginning of my journey into low-level programming and system development with Rust.

And in this project nothing interesting projects only my learning codes and notes for me.

If anyone is interested and doesn't know Rust yet, they can take a look.

## ðŸ“š Learning Journey

I've been actively learning Rust through structured online courses. Here are my verified learning certificates:

- âœ… [**Programming Rust** â€“ University of California, Davis](https://coursera.org/share/dc6497c0019059cb745164d1af3861aa)
- âœ… [**Advanced Programming in Rust** â€“ University of California, Davis](https://coursera.org/share/639c1d6a2781b452cfc7b635aafdab6f)
- âœ… [**Using Rust for Memory-Safe Systems Programming** â€“ University of California, Davis](https://coursera.org/share/f781453519fbfcc27b118c69d2d8a73e)
- âœ… [**Concurrent Programming in Rust** â€“ University of California, Davis](https://coursera.org/share/2557cc6f9716be33d9a49bc8d8b703af)

These courses helped me build a solid foundation in ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, error handling, concurrency, and system-level design in Rust. Also helped my strong programming experience with 3+years.
